How hard is it to do that? Very hard, going by 2 million or more years of evolution which have hardwired those instincts into your psyche. Oh! but dint mother nature know that I would one day make a living trading the markets? She dint, what she did knew was that the slight rustling of the leaves that your great-great-great-great great grand father heard was on a rare occasion, a tiger, so the optimum response was to flee always. &#xA0;Fear was a protector then, but an inhibitor in the modern world of high finance. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book Review : Inspired How to Create Tech Products Customers Love by Marty Cagan]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Product management is a hot term these days, it generates a lot of intrigue and debate.

The volume of literature available on the subject has risen exponentially in recent years. An entire industry has cropped up to consult entrepreneurs and executives. Long story short, <a href="https://airfocus.com/blog/surprising-product-management-stats/">PM is hot these days</a>. &#xA0;One only has to look at the beeline B-School grads are making (which is a very good marker for the industry in vogue). The naysayers would say PM is huff-n-puff, but the proof is in the pudding. &#xA0;Technology is <a href="https://future.a16z.com/software-is-eating-the-world/">truly eating the world</a>, but the best technology is still useless if no-one really needs it. &#xA0;This is evidenced by Marty Cagan at the beginning of his book, when he recounts how HP somehow conspired to fail with a team of the world&apos;s best engineers at the time. &#xA0;The reason? No one wanted what they had built. &#xA0;We now understand, how absolutely vital the PM&apos;s role is. &#xA0;We tend to appreciate less the fact that despite such great responsibilities, the humble PM is not granted any great powers, in fact he has to win over everyone to accomplish anything. To succeed, he has to be astute with people, read the market very well and know how to execute,execute, execute and execute. Sounds very much like the E-word. &#xA0;Cagan, a PM veteran who has launched some of the world&apos;s most admired products, says very clearly that to win you need to orient and think collaboration from the get-go. Innovation and ideas don&apos;t come from focus groups, but &#xA0;from everyone who is involved in building for, or talking to, the customers &#xA0;(which means pretty much everyone in a reasonably small company). This collaborative innovative-thinking-from-everyone approach is echoed by some of the world&apos;s best entrepreneurs.</p><p>Cagan, also puts into perspective, the two elephants in the room <em>LEAN </em>and <em>AGILE</em>, used correctly these frameworks can absolutely supercharge innovation, the rub? the way they are thought about and implemented, is inherently flawed in most companies. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to build a free awesome looking modern blog without writing code?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Install node,npm --&gt; install ghost --&gt; deploy ghost --&gt; choose theme --&gt; publish --&gt; convert to static --&gt; host on free hosts</p><p></p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/first-story/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">619ea69cfdbdfd2a473e7d81</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shankhadip Majumder]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:55:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Install node,npm --&gt; install ghost --&gt; deploy ghost --&gt; choose theme --&gt; publish --&gt; convert to static --&gt; host on free hosts</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
