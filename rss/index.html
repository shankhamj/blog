How hard is it to do that? Very hard, going by 2 million or more years of evolution which have hardwired those instincts into your psyche. Oh! but dint mother nature know that I would one day make a living trading the markets? She dint, what she did knew was that the slight rustling of the leaves that your great-great-great-great great grand father heard was on a rare occasion, a tiger, so the optimum response was to flee always. &#xA0;Fear was a protector then, but an inhibitor in the modern world of high finance. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Book Review : Inspired How to Create Tech Products Customers Love by Marty Cagan]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Product management is a hot term these days, generating a lot of intrigue and debate.

The volume of literature available on the subject has risen exponentially in recent years. An entire industry has cropped up to consult entrepreneurs and executives. Long story short, <a href="https://airfocus.com/blog/surprising-product-management-stats/">PM is hot these days</a>. One only has to look at the beeline of B-School grads trying to get into PM. (which is a good proxy for the &apos;hot&apos; industry of the day, think finance before &apos;08 ). The naysayers would say PM is huff-n-puff, but the proof is in the pudding. Technology is still<a href="https://future.a16z.com/software-is-eating-the-world/"> eating the world</a>, but the best technology is useless if no one needs it.</p><p>Marty Cagan begins by emphasising this point. He cites the example of HP, failing with a team of the world&apos;s best engineers at the time. The reason? No one wanted what they had built. It is a stark reminder of how vital the PM&apos;s role is. Despite such responsibilities, the humble PM has minimal formal oversight. To succeed, a PM has to be astute with people, read the market very well, and possess a strong execution bias.</p><p>These qualities are remarkably similar to those needed in an entrepreneur. Cagan, a PM veteran who has launched some of the world&apos;s most admired products, states very clearly, collaborative thinking is essential for success. Innovation and ideas don&apos;t come from focus groups but from everyone involved in building for, or talking to, the customers (which means pretty much everyone in a reasonably small company). Some of the best entrepreneurs in the world echo this collaborative innovative-thinking-from-everyone approach.</p><p>Cagan then addresses the two elephants in the room, <em>LEAN </em>and <em>AGILE. U</em>sed correctly, they can supercharge innovation, the rub? Companies think about and implement them in the wrong way.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to build a free awesome looking modern blog without writing code?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Install node,npm --&gt; install ghost --&gt; deploy ghost --&gt; choose theme --&gt; publish --&gt; convert to static --&gt; host on free hosts</p><p></p>]]></description><link>http://localhost:2368/first-story/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">619ea69cfdbdfd2a473e7d81</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shankhadip Majumder]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:55:06 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Install node,npm --&gt; install ghost --&gt; deploy ghost --&gt; choose theme --&gt; publish --&gt; convert to static --&gt; host on free hosts</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
